# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 30 , 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented Bubble sort in C++.

**Thoughts**: I started quite late but as we know "Better late than never". So no need of Day 0. I didn't know much about c++ but slowly and gradually i will learn it.

### Day 2: June 1 , 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented quick sort in C++.

**Thoughts**: I started with merge but it took time so i shifted to quick. Merge sort has some errors which has to be resolved.
I will try to improve my coding skills more as there is a lot more to learn.

### Day 3: June 3 , 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented Selection sort in C++.

**Thoughts**: Need to improve more on understanding. I am also thinking to code on some other languages so lets see how far it goes.

**Link to work**: [Selection sort](https://github.com/IamRahul16/Somecodes/blob/master/selection_sort.cpp)

### Day 4: June 4 , 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented Insertion sort in C++.

**Thoughts**: Had to study some other topics so i ended up doing just one algorithm. Just merge sort left now.

**Link to work**: [Insertion sort](https://github.com/IamRahul16/Somecodes/blob/master/insertion_sort.cpp)

### Day 5: June 5 , 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented Iterative and Recursive Binary Search in C++.

**Thoughts**: Today seems to be a bit lazy day but i have tried to code these two.

**Link to work**: [Iterative binary](https://github.com/IamRahul16/Somecodes/blob/master/iterative_binary.cpp) [Recursive binary](https://github.com/IamRahul16/Somecodes/blob/master/recursive_binary.cpp)

### Day 6: June 7 , 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented Merge sort in C++.

**Thoughts**: Some repetitive mistakes were there but i have tried to solve it. Took more than a day :/

**Link to work**: [merge sort](https://github.com/IamRahul16/Somecodes/blob/master/merge.cpp)

### Day 7: June 10 , 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented Linked List in C.

**Thoughts**: Was not able to find time to code but finally implemented this one. Its a tough one for me coz i dont know much about pointers and all. Hope to keep a regular schedule for this.

**Link to work**: [Linked List](https://github.com/IamRahul16/Somecodes/blob/master/linklist_display.c)

### Day 8: June 15 , 2020

**Today's Progress**: Inserting node at beginning of linked list.

**Thoughts**: I was busy with some other stuff, so couldn't find time to code. I have to prepare a schedule and work more over programming.

**Link to work**: [Linked List(1.1)](https://github.com/IamRahul16/Somecodes/blob/master/linklist_beginn.c)

### Day 9: June 20 , 2020

**Today's Progress**: Inserting node at nth position of linked list.

**Thoughts**: Not getting time to code but finally i have made this one. Quite tricky for the nth one but its nice. 

**Link to work**: [Linked List(1.2)](https://github.com/IamRahul16/Somecodes/blob/master/linklist_nthpos.cpp)

### Day 10: June 25 , 2020

**Today's Progress**: Deleting a node at nth position of linked list.

**Thoughts**: Took some time to code and was a bit lazy too. But yes, now i am understanding link list. 

**Link to work**: [Linked List(1.3)](https://github.com/IamRahul16/Somecodes/blob/master/linklist_del.c)

### Day 11: July 1  , 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemetation of stack using arrays in c and c++.

**Thoughts**: Busy with the exams. I will continue with Linked list after some days. 

**Link to work**: [Stack](https://github.com/IamRahul16/Somecodes/tree/master/stack%20using%20arr)

### Day 12: July 5  , 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemetation of stack using linked list in c.

**Thoughts**: Need to have that regularity. 

**Link to work**: [Stack_list](https://github.com/IamRahul16/Somecodes/blob/master/stack%20using%20linklist/stackllist.c)
