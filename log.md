# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 30 , 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented Bubble sort in C++.

**Thoughts**: I started quite late but as we know "Better late than never". So no need of Day 0. I didn't know much about c++ but slowly and gradually i will learn it.

### Day 2: June 1 , 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented quick sort in C++.

**Thoughts**: I started with merge but it took time so i shifted to quick. Merge sort has some errors which has to be resolved.
I will try to improve my coding skills more as there is a lot more to learn.
