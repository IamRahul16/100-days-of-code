# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 30 , 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented Bubble sort in C++.

**Thoughts**: I started quite late but as we know "Better late than never". So no need of Day 0. I didn't know much about c++ but slowly and gradually i will learn it.

### Day 2: June 1 , 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented quick sort in C++.

**Thoughts**: I started with merge but it took time so i shifted to quick. Merge sort has some errors which has to be resolved.
I will try to improve my coding skills more as there is a lot more to learn.

### Day 3: June 2 , 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented selection sort in C++.

**Thoughts**: Need to improve more on understanding. I am also thinking to code on some other languages so lets see how far it goes.

### Day 4: June 3 , 2020

**Today's Progress**: Implemented selection sort in C++.

**Thoughts**: Had to study some other topics so i ended up doing just one algorithm. Just merge sort left now.

**Link to work**: [Insertion sort](https://github.com/IamRahul16/Somecodes/blob/master/insertion_sort.cpp)
